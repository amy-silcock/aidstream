<p>Dear {{$adminName}},</p>

<p>A user has requested a user account on your {{$orgName}} AidStream account.</p>

<p>Here is the message which {{$full_name}} has sent you via AidStream:</p>

<p>“{{$content}}”</p>

<p>It seems {{$full_name}} with email address, {{$email}}, is a member of your organisation who is trying to create themselves a user account on AidStream. It is not possible for a user to create
    themselves a user account on your organisation’s account. You, the admin of your organisation’s account has to create an account for the user. You can create the account from AidStream account
    Settings page under the Users section.</p>

<p>If you do not recognise the user’s name or email but believe they may belong to your organisation, please email them to find out more.</p>

<p>If you have any questions, you can reach us at support@aidstream.org</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>The AidStream Team</p>
